# About

This site started at the monthly civic hackathon of the [Detroit Urban Tech Meetup](https://github.com/detroit-urban-tech-meetup).

The principal motivation is to build a friendly "front-end" to the Detroit zoning code; currently living as a [very large PDF](https://detroitmi.gov/sites/detroitmi.localhost/files/2018-11/ZONING%20ORD%2010-14-18.pdf) on the city's website.

## FAQ

### What's a zoning code?

> [Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning): Zoning is the process of dividing land in a municipality into zones (e.g. residential, industrial) in which certain land uses are permitted or prohibited.[1] In addition, the sizes, bulk, and placement of buildings may regulated.

### How is this site built?

> This is a [Gatsby site](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) which uses [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com) as a back-end for organizing the zoning data into a relational database.

### How can I contribute to this site?

> There's a couple ways to help! You can help fill out the [Airtable base](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invBcLP4bIHK6r4Xk&inviteToken=220a85cbf3a63ee6b76c80a812a4da179577d7c88d1b4a6cc801be33783c6709) where we're trying to structure the zoning data into a spreadsheet format. (That's a read-only link; please contact [Jimmy McBroom](mailto:james.mcbroom@gmail.com) for an editor link.)

> If you're interested in developing this site, take a look at the [GitHub repository!](https://github.com/detroit-urban-tech-meetup/zoning-guide-detroit). If you can't figure out where to get started, please feel free to open a new issue.
